# KECAP WEBSITE

TL;DR => A sample kecap store made using react js 

**What's this?**
This mini project was created as a practice for making CRUD frontend using react js.
The navigations were made using react-router.

**CONCERNS**
For some reason, all request were blocked by CORS even though it was already set by the golang API.
Therefore, there's no actual data being thrown around for communication.
